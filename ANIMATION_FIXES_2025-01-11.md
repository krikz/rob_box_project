# Animation Fixes - January 11, 2025

## Overview
Fixed 10 animation issues based on user testing feedback after v2.5 improvements.

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Police Text Height (3px → 5px)
**Problem**: Cyrillic text "ПОЛИЦИЯ" only 3 pixels tall instead of 5
**Solution**: 
- Expanded Cyrillic character maps from 3 rows to 5 rows in `_create_russian_text_scroll()`
- Changed `draw_y = 1 + py` to `draw_y = py` to use all display height (rows 0-4)
- All 6 characters (П О Л И Ц Я) now properly rendered at 5 pixels tall

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/generate_animation_frames.py` - Updated cyrillic font definition
- Regenerated: `frames/police/*.png`

---

### ✅ 2. Turn Left - Confirmed Working
**Status**: Already working correctly - left wheels blink orange, right rear shows red brake light

---

### ✅ 3. Turn Right - Missing Red Rear Light
**Problem**: Left rear wheel showed dim white instead of red brake light
**Solution**:
- Split left wheels generation in `generate_turn_right()`:
  - Front left: dim white headlight (80, 80, 80)
  - Rear left: red brake light (150, 0, 0)
- Now symmetric with turn_left behavior

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/generate_animation_frames.py` - `generate_turn_right()` method
- Regenerated: `frames/navigation/wheel_rl_red.png`, `wheel_fl_dim.png`

---

### ✅ 4. Angry - Static Rear Wheels
**Problem**: Rear wheels not animated during angry emotion
**Solution**:
- Added rear wheel generation loop with 3-frame red pulsing pattern
- Intensities: 200, 150, 100 (aggressive red glow)
- Matches front wheel animation timing

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/generate_animation_frames.py` - `generate_angry()` method
- `animations/manifests/angry.yaml` - Added wheel_rear_left and wheel_rear_right panels
- Regenerated: `frames/emotions/wheel_rl_angry_*.png`, `wheel_rr_angry_*.png`

---

### ✅ 5. Braking - Static Front Headlights
**Problem**: Front headlights static, requested expanding effect ("пусть типа расширяются")
**Solution**:
- Created new helper method `_create_expanding_glow()` for circular glow effect
- 4-frame animation with expanding radius (2.0 → 4.4 pixels)
- Slight dimming as glow expands (255 → 165 brightness)
- Represents light spreading during braking

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/generate_animation_frames.py` - Added `_create_expanding_glow()` and updated `generate_braking()`
- Regenerated: `frames/navigation/eye_fl_brake_*.png`, `eye_fr_brake_*.png`

---

### ✅ 6. Idle - Rear Animation Check
**Status**: Frames already existed from v2.5 improvements (6-frame rear glow)
**Action**: Manifest verified - already using correct frame references

---

### ✅ 7. Sad - Rear Animation Check  
**Status**: User manually edited manifest, frames exist (4-frame blue pulsing)
**Action**: Verified manifest references match generated frames

---

### ✅ 8. Sleep - Static Rear Wheels
**Problem**: Rear wheels were completely off (black)
**Solution**:
- Generated 5-frame dim blue pulsing pattern
- Very subtle: 15-25 brightness (sleeping ambiance)
- Blue tint for calm sleep mode
- Changed from static `wheel_rl_off.png` to animated sequence

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/generate_animation_frames.py` - `generate_sleep()` method
- `animations/manifests/sleep.yaml` - Added rear wheel panels with 5 frames
- Regenerated: `frames/system/wheel_rl_sleep_*.png`, `wheel_rr_sleep_*.png`

---

### ✅ 9. Surprised - Rear Animation Check
**Status**: Frames already existed from v2.5 improvements (6-frame yellow flashing)
**Action**: Manifest verified - already using correct frame references

---

### ✅ 10. Thinking - Rear Animation Check
**Status**: Frames already existed from v2.5 improvements (8-frame purple pulsing)
**Action**: Manifest verified - already using correct frame references

---

### ✅ 11. Wakeup - Weak Rear Animation
**Problem**: Rear wheel animation too subtle ("практически незаметно")
**Solution**:
- Increased brightness range: 30 → 120 (was probably 30-50 before)
- 6-frame progressive brightening sequence
- White color for waking energy
- Much more visible animation

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/generate_animation_frames.py` - `generate_wakeup()` method
- `animations/manifests/wakeup.yaml` - Added rear wheel panels with 6 frames
- Regenerated: `frames/system/wheel_rl_wakeup_*.png`, `wheel_rr_wakeup_*.png`

---

## Technical Changes Summary

### New Code Features
1. **`_create_expanding_glow()` method** - Circular glow with progressive radius
   - Parameters: size, radius, color
   - Intensity gradient from center (100%) to edge (70%)
   - Used for braking expanding headlight effect

### Modified Animation Methods
1. `_create_russian_text_scroll()` - 5-row Cyrillic font
2. `generate_turn_right()` - Split rear light (red brake)
3. `generate_angry()` - Added rear wheel pulsing
4. `generate_braking()` - Expanding glow headlights
5. `generate_sleep()` - Dim pulsing rear wheels
6. `generate_wakeup()` - Bright progressive rear animation

### Updated Manifests (to v2.5)
- `angry.yaml` - Added rear wheels (3 frames each)
- `sleep.yaml` - Added rear wheels (5 frames each)
- `wakeup.yaml` - Added rear wheels (6 frames each)

### Frame Statistics
**Generated new frames**:
- Police: 22 frames (10 display + 12 wheels)
- Turn right: 14 frames
- Angry: 6 frames (rear wheels)
- Braking: 8 frames (expanding front)
- Sleep: 10 frames (rear pulsing)
- Wakeup: 12 frames (rear brightening)

**Total**: 72 new/regenerated frames

## Testing Recommendations

### Visual Verification
Use visualizer to check:
```bash
python3 scripts/visualize_animations.py
```

**Check these specific animations**:
1. **Police** - Text should be 5 pixels tall and readable
2. **Turn Right** - Left rear should glow red (brake light)
3. **Angry** - All 4 wheels should pulse red aggressively
4. **Braking** - Front headlights should expand outward (4 frames)
5. **Sleep** - Rear wheels should have subtle dim blue pulse
6. **Wakeup** - Rear wheels should brighten noticeably (30→120)

### Manifest Validation
All manifests now at v2.5 with complete 4-wheel + display coverage:
- ✅ Police (turn signals + scrolling text)
- ✅ Turn signals (asymmetric with brake lights)
- ✅ Emotions (angry, sad, surprised with rear animations)
- ✅ System states (sleep, wakeup with rear animations)
